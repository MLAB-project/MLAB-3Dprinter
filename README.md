RebeliX
=======
RebeliX â€“ a 3D printer inspired by constructions of Rebel II a Prusa i3. Licensed as GPLv3. Howto and list of materials is available on www.RebeliX.cz (currently only in Czech, we are working on it, help is appreciated).

Features
=====

* Piezoelectric based precise Z-calibration
* Symmetric motor configuration push-pull to minimize belt stretching in printing of corners

Build
=====

   sudo pip install stlsort


To continue OpenSCAD has to be installed and available as `openscad` command.

1. Make necessary changes to configuration.scad according to printer that prints the parts and available hardware. 
* Generate a calibration object by `make calibration`.
* Print generated calibration.stl and repeat the steps if unhappy.

When satisfied, run `make clean && make all`. That produces STLs with your tweeks.
